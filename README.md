# Contractor's Tax Calculator    
  
The idea of this small project is to have a quick and easy-to-use calculator for contractors working in the UK through their limited companies.  
  
For the moment, this calculator only works with tax rules for 2016/2017 tax year, and it **does not include NICs calculations**.   

The final goal is for this program to be able to:

* Given a contractor's gross income, divided by **dividends** and **salary**, return the tax due following the specific year's rules.

* Calculation of tax hike for a contractor, when the new dividend tax will become active in April 2016. (Comparison of tax between 2015/16 and 2016/17 tax years)

* Given a contractor's daily rate under 2015/16 tax rules, return a daily rate that, with new rules for 2016/17, will correspond to the same net income  

* Support NICs calculations

* Make a small web GUI to excersise the calculator
